<p>The first part of the song "Imagine" by John Lennon (It's a nice song) is transformed by using the RiTa library. Using arrow keys you can move the green line around in order to read the original sentence.</p>

<p><b>RiTa functions</b></p>
<p>From the RiTa library I have used four different functions in order to transform the original words: 1) Phonemes, 2) pos, 3) rhymes and 4) random words. Besides those functions I have used some other functions, like RiString() and analyze(). 
</p>
<p><b>Working with found text</b></p>
<p>It was kind of fun, but this project has nothing to do with the text itself, really. I mean it could be changed to any other lyric. I spent some time finding some text and ended up searching for famous songs just to get started with something.</p>

<p><b>The materiality of text</b></p>
<p>Using the RiTa library is a good example of the materiality of text, because in using the library we can really see how much there is to words and text as a whole - analyzing words, changing words, rhyming words. Using another kind of materiality - using sample code - we transform a piece of text to something else.</p>
<p>The user has a sort of impact through this project: he or she can manipulate the text to make it easier to read by moving the green line like a pair of looking glasses to see through the "nonsense" of the transformation. And by refreshing to see other results. The user can grasp the text in a way and wonder about the transformation.</p>
