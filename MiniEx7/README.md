<h3>Shapes (of frustration)</h3>

<p>Well, this miniex was very frustrating. The goal was to create a sort of stair or an empty infographic allowing the user to type in the input fields what the infographic was showing. Like the age differences in a population or the growth of something. When the user pressed the button, it would be showed in a paragraph/text box next to it. As you can see in the screenshot and in the program, it instead displays a error that I couldn't figure out at the time. And the whole art-thing was difficult to mee, too :/ </p>

<p>Objects: There are many advantages using objects; like structuring the code, reuse, readablitity, sharing work and doing work together. Hmm, limitations ... I haven't met that many limitations, maybe when making something very simple, making it object oriented can be a bit time consuming. There are types of programs that doesn't need object oriented structure or maybe needs a different structure, like more event based. So far some of the miniexs were more likely to need events than for us to build classes and using objects.</p>
