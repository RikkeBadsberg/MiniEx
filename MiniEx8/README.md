<p>I chose coding challenge # 15 - the fractal trees in object oriented style</p>

<p>I changed some parts of Shiffmans code. Mainly I changed the program from adding branches at a mouse click to growing the tree instantly. The leaves fall when the mouse is clicked. I also added randomness so the trees wasn't identical each time - and added the possiblity of a third branch. Besides I added some variables to make the program easier to tweek, and I changed the branch function (Shiffman made a branchA and a branchB function which was almost identical and I merged them to one function with a parameter instead).</p>
<p>This coding challenge was kind of easy, I think. You need to understand a little about vectors, but that is about it.</p>

<p>Using a flowchart is a great way to plan and communicate the structure of the program. It allows for non-programmers and others who are not directly involved with the programming to understand the program without having to look at the code itself.</p>
