<h3>Coding process</h3>
<p>I started with drawing a circle following the mouse. For some reason I experimented with not drawing the circle close to the edge of the canvas, so it disappears close to the edge.</p>
<p>As a part of the Wedensday class I made it look like a face with two cirles for eyes. I changed the size of the circles and the fill color, untill I thought it was more fun for the user to change the size of the eyes. So I made a variable to control the eye size and made the mousePress increase it. So now it looks kind of wierd.</p>
<p>To add to the wierdness I made the background color change with the eye size.</p>
<p>Finally I made the eye size decrease when it reached a certain size, so now it increases and decreases.</p>

<h3>What constitutes a program?</h3>
<p>A program is a collection of code that does something when running on a computer. It might solve a problem or act as a tool for people to solve problems, or it might be more of an art program.</p>

<h3>What is error?</h3>
<p>An error is when something does not act or behave as intented. The funny thing about making an error in this program is that it is intentional - it might be more like a glitch that I kept; the eyes shouldn't be bigger than the head, but they can be. They don't explode, though.</p>
