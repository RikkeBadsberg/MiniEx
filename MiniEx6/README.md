<h3>MiniEx6 - Generative Art</h3>

<p>Try <b>A bit like a software Big Bang</b> out here: https://rikkebadsberg.github.io/MiniEx/MiniEx6/</P>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>I build on Winnie's generative artwork from class by adding colors and stroke to the ellipses (not cirles anymore) and playing with opacity for both the fill and stroke of the circle and with the background color.</p>
<p>It takes about 6Â½ minutes to unfold - both growing and shrinking, and it really is kind of weird at the end of its cycle.</p>

<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>There are four rules in this program:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ellipses are displayed in a grid, which is key in creating the patterns.</li>
  <li>The ellipses grows and shrinks at a certain speed.</li>
  <li>The ellipses grows at the beginning of the program, and when they reach a certain radius they decrease.</li>
  <li>The colors of the ellipses are determined by changing values and have a very low opacity.</li>
</ol> 

<h4>Concepts of Generative Art</h4>
<p>Building on Winnies generative artwork I started experimenting with the rules and changing small parts throughout a lot of iterations. I really understand what it means when a piece of generative art is not really authored by the programmer. I was not able to understand or predict what the changes would result in and I'm not really sure that I understand the effects even now. It feels like a complex, autonomous system that I can only impact vert little (I know, I could just delete it all and start over, but that is not the point). It was kind of thrilling to watch it unfold for every little change I made in the program. I don't really understand it, and I think it's kind of beautiful not being in control of it ;)</p>
