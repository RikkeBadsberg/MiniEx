<p>Description of <i>"The Hypnotic Feedback of Dots"</i></p>
<p>I thought about this project a bit more than the previous miniexs - simply because I didn't really know what to do about the whole cybernetics and feedback loop thing. So I ended up making this project with two for loops creating a grid with circles. The circles changes size and color. The feedback is based on the mouse position on the screen, and the color and size of the circles are mapped to the X and Y position. The user can create a sort of loop by moving the mouse around and trying to figure the mapping out.</p>

<p>Oh, and I forgot to draw the background/give it a color but kept this little feature/bug, because I thought it creates an awesome effect, like cylinders growing upwards toward the screen ;)</p>
