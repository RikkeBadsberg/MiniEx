<b>A bit about my thropper design</b>
<p>I wanted to stick with the original thought of a thropper so not to cause too much confusion should it be implemented.</p>
<p>The user can interact with it using space and arrow keys to change the rotation direction and position of the thropper - and in doing so the shape and colors also change.</p>
<p>This moving, changing thropper might not really be that useful (if a thropper can be useful), because it requires a bit of time to be understood and tried out - and hopefully that time is very short when loading something inbetween states in a program. For short loading waits it might be a bit overkill and for long loading waits it might be a bit boring (it not a game like Googles no-internet dinosaur game). But for 2-5 seconds max, it might be okay ;)</p>
<p>The thropper was designed as an experiment all the way through. Like "how do I change the direction of the thropper?" and "I wonder how it will look with rectangles and triangles instead of just circles, and changing colors!".</p>

<b>How might we use programming to reflect and inquire digital visual culture?</b>
<p>Well, difficult question, I think.</p>
<p>We can use programming as a tool to understand how digital visual things can be created - and in doing so it is easier to see how to change it. First by redesigning things and maybe later on how to invent new design and things that does something differently or even better (though it is difficult to define one thropper as better than another - just different. We do, after all, not really want to see the thropper in the first place). I'm not sure if this is even an answer to the question :)</p>
